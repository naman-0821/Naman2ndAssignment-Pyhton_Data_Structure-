    "String slicing in Python is a powerful technique to extract specific portions of a string. You can access characters within a string using their indices, which start from 0.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "string[start:end:step]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`start`:** Index of the first character to include (inclusive).\n",
    "* **`end`:** Index of the character after the last one to include (exclusive).\n",
    "* **`step`:** Interval between characters to be included.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "text = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Extract \"Hello\"\n",
    "print(text[:5])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Extract \"World!\"\n",
    "print(text[-5:])\n",
    "\n",

    "# Extract every other character\n",

    "**Why Dictionary Keys Must Be Immutable**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, dictionary keys must be immutable objects like strings, numbers, or tuples. This is crucial because dictionaries use a hashing mechanism to efficiently store and retrieve key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Hashing Trick:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hashing:** When you add a key-value pair to a dictionary, Python calculates a hash value for the key. This hash value helps in determining the key's location within the dictionary's internal structure.\n",
    "* **Immutability:** If keys were mutable, their hash values could change after they're added to the dictionary. This would break the dictionary's internal structure, making it impossible to find the correct value associated with the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a phonebook where names (keys) are associated with phone numbers (values). If names could change, the phonebook would become chaotic. A person named \"Alice\" might be listed under \"Alice\" at one point, and then under \"Alicia\" later, making it difficult to find their number.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In essence:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Efficiency:** Immutable keys ensure efficient lookup and retrieval of values.\n",
    "* **Consistency:** They prevent unexpected behavior and errors that could arise from changing key values.\n",
